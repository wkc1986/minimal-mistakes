I am interested in studying microbial ecosystems are an especially rich, fast-moving, and well-surveyed instance of a complex system.
My perspective typically draws from information theory, network theory, and statistical physics.

For a current list of publications, see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RCTd8bcAAAAJ&hl=en) page.

## Ongoing projects

* The evolution of genomic and ecological diversity in sympatric marine bacteriophages.

* The dynamics of state transitions in microbial ecosystems.

## Past projects

### PhD: ecological modeling of intercellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment

* Modeling collective cell motion driven by tumor cell-macrophage interactions.

* Modeling breast cancer cell population dynamics under macrophage-targeted chemotherapy.
