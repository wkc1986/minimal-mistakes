* Why is it easy to understand the few, but nigh-impossible to understand the many?
* What is order? How does order emerge from disorder?
  * Relatedly, how does non-uniformity emerge from uniformity?
* How does human experience categorize a continuum of innumerable possibilities into a finite set of meaningful outcomes, and are there 'objective' correlates for this categorization?
* How do systems drive their own organization, and also their own collapse?
* The individual human exists on a fixed time scale of (approximately) decades and fixed length scale of (approximately) meters, whereas the (biological, physical, sociological) phenomena that ultimately affect our lives occur on all time (from seconds to centuries) and length (from your block to the planet) scales. How, then, shall one understand and come to terms with a universe that is simultaneously far larger and far smaller, far more ephemeral and far more enduring than oneself?
