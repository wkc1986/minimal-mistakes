You can find my CV [here](https://github.com/wkc1986/wkc-cv/blob/master/wkc-cv.pdf).

I'm currently a postdoc at the [Libusha Kelly lab](http://www.kellylab.org/), studying the ecology and evolution of marine and human microbiomes, in the [Systems and Computational Biology Department at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine](https://www.einstein.yu.edu/departments/systems-computational-biology/) in New York City.

My scientific interests include:

* complex systems---biological, physical, social---of which microbial ecosystems are an especially rich, fast-moving, and well-surveyed example;

* the convergence of data and human-intuitive theory in the understanding thereof.

I typically draw inspiration from information theory, network theory, and statistical physics, among other things.

[These](/questions/) are some questions I sometimes think about, that may or may not ever be answered.
