I'm currently a postdoc at the [Libusha Kelly lab](http://www.kellylab.org/), studying the ecology and evolution of marine and human microbiomes, in the [Systems and Computational Biology Department at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine](https://www.einstein.yu.edu/departments/systems-computational-biology/) in New York City.
