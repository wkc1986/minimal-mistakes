Hi, I'm Will.
I'm a postdoctoral scientist in New York City.
My current work is in the field of microbial ecology and metagenomics.

My interests include:

* complex systems---biological, physical, social;

* the convergence of data and human-intuitive theory in the understanding thereof.

I am also an [electronic musician](https://wkc1986.github.io/music/).

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/w_k_chang).

My [Github](https://github.com/wkc1986) contains code for mangling data and/or audio.

*These pages are likely to be under construction.*

I'm currently a postdoc at the [Libusha Kelly lab](http://www.kellylab.org/), focusing on microbial ecology and evolution, in the [Systems and Computational Biology Department at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine](https://www.einstein.yu.edu/departments/systems-computational-biology/) in New York City.

I am also an electronic musician.
